#### Navigating the Shiny App

We developed this R Shiny app to enable readers and conservation planners in the boreal region to explore the results of the analysis (Vernier et al. *in prep*) and to identify species/assemblages and bird conservation regions (BCRs) combinations that are adequately or inadequately represented by benchmark networks selected using environmental surrogates. The app is divided into four sections:

**Introduction**

  - Description - Basic description of the various sections in this app.
  - Study region - Map of bird conservation regions (BCRs) and ecozones comprising the the boreal region of Canada.
  - Species - Names and assemblage membership for the songbird and waterfowl species used in the analysis.
  - Networks - Number of representative and non-representative benchmark networks by ecoregion.

**Representativeness**

Violin plots comparing the dissimilarity values of representative and non-representative networks by BCR unit. The **Create plots..." button needs to be clicked to generate the plots.

  - Feature 1 - Violin plots for species or assemblage selected from the "Feature 1" dropdown list in the left hand panel.
  - Feature 2 - Violin plots for species or assemblage selected from the "Feature 2" dropdown list in the left hand panel.

**Surrogates importance**

Results from regression analysis for each feature-BCR unit combination, including estimate, std error of the estimate and t-statistic.

  - Feature 1 - Table for species or assemblage selected from the "Feature 1" dropdown list in the left hand panel.
  - Feature 2 - Table for species or assemblage selected from the "Feature 2" dropdown list in the left hand panel.

**Case studies**

  - Case study 1: Representation method comparison. The surrogates manuscript defines networks as representative if they meet two representation evaluations: the MDR-based target method and the dissimilarity method.
  - Case study 2: Evaluating the effectiveness of surrogates. Illustration of the basic steps for evaluating the effectiveness of four environmental surrogates for four test features (ConiferBirds, DeciduousBirds, MixedwoodBirds, and GrasslandBirds) that occur in the boreal region of Canada.
