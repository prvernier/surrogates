### Boreal songbirds

As part of a pan-boreal project, five boreal songbird species were identified as forestry-relevant, and selected based on threat status, geographic distribution, and biology: Blackburnian Warbler (BLWA), Black-throated Green Warbler (BTNW), Canada Warbler (CAWA), Cape May Warbler (CMWA), and Olive-sided Flycatcher (OSFL). These species are representative of broad habitat types that occur across the boreal. Blackburnian Warbler is associated with mixedwood forests consisting of 50-70% conifer species by canopy; Black-throated Green Warbler is associated with mixedwood forest with <= 30 percent conifer species (mainly spruce) by canopy; Canada Warbler is associated with relatively pure deciduous forests; Cape May Warbler is associated with relatively pure conifer forests; and Olive-sided Flycatcher is associated with forested wetlands.

The NWBLCC selected a suite of priority focal species based on vulnerability to future landscape change as well as social/cultural importance. After consulting with partner organizations and external experts, the NWBLCC identified a set of 10 focal species that includes two species groups (Table 1). All species reside within both Canada and Alaska. The waterfowl species were merged into a Waterfowl Guild because data are scarce. The five species of Old‐Forest Birds were selected based on their association with old forest and predicted decline under climate change (Stralberg et al. 2014). Other species considered, but not included, were brown bear, golden eagle, snowshoe hare, and two old‐forest birds: Blackpoll Warbler and Common Redpoll.

  * Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus)
  * Old‐Forest Birds ‐ Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), White‐Winged Crossbill (Loxia leucoptera), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus)
  * Waterfowl Guild ‐ Trumpeter Swan (Cygnus buccinator), Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis), White‐Winged Scoter (Melanitta deglandi)

**Processing Species Data**

  * Read density map
  * Project and clip to study region
  * Mask out large waterbodies
  * Mask out very low density values (see maps in PBA document)

**Calculating "All Birds" and "Forest Birds" groups**
